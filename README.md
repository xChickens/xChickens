### Hi there, I'm Chris! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year student at the University of California, San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and I'm aspiring a career in Software Engineering. My current expectations are to complete my degree by Spring 2021 and finish the B.S./M.S. program to complete my M.S. in Computer Science by Spring 2022.

Currently, I'm looking for full-time opportunities for Summer 2022, in any fields of Software Development. Please feel free to contact me for more information! Thank you!
